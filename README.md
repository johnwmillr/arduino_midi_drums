# Arduino-based MIDI drum controller

The code in this project is the basis for my 2016 Halloween costume, a *fully-functional MIDI drum machine*. If you're interested in an overview of the whole project, check out my [tutorial on Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Functional-MIDI-Drum-Machine-Costume/ "John's Instructables tutorial").

I'm also trying to learn Markdown right now, hence the **odd emphases** and ~~unnecessary~~ necessary table below.

| Here's | That Table | I   |*Mentioned*|
| :----: | :--------: | :-: | :-------: |
| O      |      O     |  X  |  **$**    |
|        |      X     |     |  *$*      |
|  X     |            |  O  |  *__$__*  |

*It looks like...*
> X wins


Nothing else to see here. *__Enjoy the code.__*
