# Arduino-based MIDI drum controller

The code in this project is the basis for a Halloween costume I made in 2016, a fully-functional MIDI drum machine.

Check out my [tutorial on Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Functional-MIDI-Drum-Machine-Costume/ "John's Instructables tutorial") if you're interested in an overview of the whole project.
